## Managing Peak Hour Patient Flow at Urban Multi-Specialty Clinic
## Context: 
Jayanagar Specialty Clinic in Bangalore sees 300+ patients daily with peak congestion between 5-8pm when working professionals arrive. The 15 specialists have varying consultation patterns.

## Problem Outline:
Situation: 
- The clinic reports 40-minute average wait times during evening hours, with some patients waiting up to 90 minutes

Data Available:
- 3 months of appointment records showing scheduled vs. actual times
- Doctor-wise average consultation durations (ranging from 8-22 minutes)
- Peak vs. non-peak hour patient distribution (75% of patients prefer evening slots)

## Evaluation Task:
- Design an AI approach that could reduce evening wait times by at least 30%
- Suggest 3 specific prediction features that would be most valuable
- Explain how the system should handle the common scenario of patients arriving 20-30 minutes before their appointment expecting to be seen earlier

## Expected Solution Elements:
- Predictive load balancing across available doctors
- Time-slot optimization based on consultation patterns
- Patient communication strategy for realistic wait time
