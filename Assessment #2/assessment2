# Assessment 2:

## Scenario-Based Assessment

## Problem Statement: 
"Schedula needs to implement an Intelligent Queue Management system for a medical practice with the following characteristics:
- 50 doctors with varied scheduling patterns
- Each doctor sees 30-50 patients daily in 3-hour blocks
- Patients arrive unpredictably, often not at their scheduled times
- Appointments come from multiple channels (IVR, app, WhatsApp)
- Walk-in patients need to be accommodated
- Some doctors track patient status (arrived, waiting, consulted), but not all"

## Task Requirements:
1. Break down this problem into logical components and steps (no technical knowledge required)
2. Identify what information would be necessary to make intelligent queuing decisions
3. Describe how you would measure if your queue management system is working effectively
4. Explain how the system should handle communication with patients about wait times
5. Record a 3-minute Loom video explaining your approach
