# Assessment 2


## Scenario-Based Assessment

## Problem Statement: 
"Schedula needs to implement an Intelligent Queue Management system for a medical practice with the following characteristics:

- Walk-in patients need to be accommodated
- Some doctors track patient status (arrived, waiting, consulted), but not all"
